I am a PhD candidate at the [Utrecht Geometry Centre](https://utrechtgeometrycentre.nl)
under the supervision of [Dr. Álvaro del Pino Gómez](https://alvarodelpino.com).
My work focusses on the h-principle and in particular convex integration
as a method to prove h-principles.

My interests lie more generally within the field of
				geometric/differential topology. The line between geometric
				topology, differential topology and differential geometry is
				blurry and the different fields have an important interplay, but
				at its simplest I am interested in the interplay between the
				geometric structure on a manifold and the underlying topology of
				the manifold (or other spaces associated to the geometric
				structure). To name a few examples in this spirit:
- The de Rham isomorphism theorem
- Morse functions
- Myers' theorem: complete Riemannian manifolds with positive Ricci curvature are compact
- Smale-Hirsch immersion theorem & Smale's sphere eversion
